You may be wondering why I don't write content in English. It is easy to understand, many years ago I decided that there was already enough information in English (if not all the information), so I decided to write content in Spanish in order to make easier for Spanish-speaking newcomers to acquire knowledge. Unfortunately this means that almost all the links you'll find in my articles lead to English content as is the most common language in software engineering.
